# Hi 😃, I'm Ivan Linares 👨🏻‍💻 👋🏻


## What can I say about me? 🤔


Right now I'm a full time student. My goal is to become a software developer 👨🏻‍💻.

I found my passion when I started coding, that's why I decided join Microverse. As a Microverse student, I learn coding by making my own projects, which is amazing. I'm currently learning these languages:
- JavaScript 
- Java 
- Python.

I’m looking for to collaborate on different kind of projects, because this is the way I learn coding. I'm new in this industry, but I really like learn new things and at the same time enjoy the whole process of making new projects. ✨✨

I'm friendly and if you have some feedback about me, or my projects, feel free to let me know how can I improve. 

If you have any question feel free to contact me:
