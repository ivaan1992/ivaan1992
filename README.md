What can I say about me? 🤔

Right now I'm a full time student. My goal is to become a software developer 👨🏻‍💻.


I'm in the college rigth now taking 2 bachelor's degrees 🤓. I'm coursing systems engineering and at the same time I'm coursing business management. I'm about to finish business management career, but I found my passion when I started coding when the COVID attacked. I also, I'm a Microverse student, but in this school I learn coding by making my own projects, which is amazing. I'm currently learning JavaScript, and Java but I'm planning start learning Python, C#, C++, PHP. 


Before discover the tech world, I was busy in my own little company. So I have experience leading people and working with all kind of people. At the same time I really like to try new things. I also like to meet new people. I'm friendly and if you have some feedback about me, or my projects, feel free to let me know how can I improve. 

I’m looking to collaborate on different kind of projects, because this is the way I learn coding. I'm new in this industry, but I like learn new things and at the same time enjoy the whole process. ✨✨

PS: Sometimes I write texts about me and personal life 📝.
