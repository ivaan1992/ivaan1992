# Hi 👋🏻, I'm Ivan Linares 🧔🏻‍ 


## What can I say about me? 🤔


Right now I'm a full time student. My goal is to become a software developer 👨🏻‍💻.

I found my passion when I started coding, that's why I decided join Microverse. As a Microverse student, I learn coding by making my own projects, which is amazing. I'm currently learning these languages:
- JavaScript 
- Java 
- Python.

I’m looking for collaborate on different kind of projects, because this is the way I learn coding. I'm new in this industry, but I really like learn new things and at the same time enjoy the whole process of making new projects.

I'm friendly and if you have some feedback about me, or my projects, feel free to let me know how can I improve. 

If you have any question feel free to contact me:
